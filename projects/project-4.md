This project I built for the company I worked for to find a way to better manage the classes, students, parents and teachers. The backend is built on Django and python and allows for the scheduling of classes, tracking hours, payments and much more. 

It is primarily a business tool for the school and is based on internal processes and systems and is custom built based on the needs of the school. The app also runs rabbitMQ and sends daily email reminders to teachers to complete certain tasks on thee app. 

The second phase was to branch out the parent side of the app so parents can log in and view the classses of their students.
