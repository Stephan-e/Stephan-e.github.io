This project I did as part of a team of students where we put up a small down winnd turbine to test the hypothesis of winnd turbines without a tail and moves into the wind through the blade design. 

The wind turbinne was set up and successfully generated power after implementation. The design of the turbine and generator was part of research work that I completed at the University of Stellenbosch.
